# Embedal playground

A hot-reloadable TypeScript + Three.js scene with space reserved for future embedding visualizations.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server uses Vite with HMR. Visit the printed URL (default http://localhost:5173) and you should see a black scene, a rotating wireframe mesh, and a centered square UI canvas placeholder ready for embedding experiments.
